Select the type of the new proposal:

* **Signaling proposal**: gasless proposal creation using Vochain layer 2 solutions. (For example, a Signaling proposal is great for an initial discussion, and collecting feedback).
* **On-chain proposal**: metadata is stored on Ethereum, increasing decentralization and verifiability. (For example, on-chain proposal can be created after the community has discussed the signaling proposal and provided feedback).

Fill in all the fields in the new proposal.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Title:** insert a title for your proposal

**Description:** a description of what your proposal is about

**Proposal date:** the period during which the vote is open

**Question:** a short description of what the vote is about

**Description:** a description of what the vote is about

**Add question:** if your proposal has more than one vote
{% endhint %}

Click _**create proposal**_\*\* \*\* and approve the transaction on your wallet.
