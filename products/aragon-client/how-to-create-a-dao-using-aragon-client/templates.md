# Templates

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn which are the templates available for creating a DAO and which are the main differences.
{% endhint %}

## What are templates?

Templates are pre-configured smart contracts for different types of organizations. You can use the templates that are included with Aragon or [create your own](https://github.com/aragon/dao-templates).

## Template types

### [Company](use-company-template.md)

A Company organization is an organization that uses **transferable tokens** to represent stake in the company. Decisions are made using **token-weighted voting**, where one token equals one vote.

### [Membership](use-membership-template.md)

A Membership organization is an organization that uses a **non-transferable token** to represent membership. Decisions are made based on **one-member-one-vote** governance.

### [Reputation](page-1.md)

A Reputation organization is an organization that uses **non-transferable tokens** to represent reputation. Decisions are made using **reputation-weighted voting**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the default templates do not provide you with the desired solution, you can set up a [development environment](https://hack.aragon.org/) and use the [aragonCLI](https://hack.aragon.org/developers/tools/aragoncli) to [create a custom organization](https://hack.aragon.org/developers/tools/guides/custom-deploy).
