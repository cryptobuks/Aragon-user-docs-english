# How to create a DAO

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn how to create a DAO using the Aragon Client. In the example below we will use the Rinkeby Network.
{% endhint %}

## How to create a DAO

* Log in to your Web3 wallet (e.g. Metamask), select your account address and the network you want to use.
* Go [here](https://aragon.org) and click the _**Create your DAO**_ button and then choose to use _**Aragon Client**._
* Check that the wallet account is connected (as shown in the image), if not press _**connect wallet**_.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Remember that you'll need 0.2ETH (or more depending on the network traffic) to create a DAO on the Ethereum network. So it's recommended that you use a test network (like Rinkeby) when setting up your first DAO. For more info about how to connect to a Test Network go [here](../../set-up-metamask/getting-started-with-rinkeby-testnet.md).
