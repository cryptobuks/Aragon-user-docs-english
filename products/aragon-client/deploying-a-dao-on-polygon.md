# How to create a DAO on Polygon

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, we will walk you through how to deploy a DAO using the Aragon Client on the Polygon network. You can either watch the **Video** or you can read the **Text** below the Video.

## What is Polygon?

[Polygon](https://polygon.technology) is an [L2 scaling solution](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/) for Ethereum. It is a 'Proof of Stake' network, where users can transact with each other for fraction of the Mainnet transaction cost.

Assets on Ethereum can be moved to Polygon and back again using [bridges](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500012881642-How-do-I-transfer-ETH-from-Ethereum-to-Polygon-). Ethereum fees are proportional to the complexity of the transaction but Polygon enables complex transactions for very low cost without leaving the Ethereum ecosystem.

**This is why Aragon has deployed its own DAO infrastructure to Polygon, effectively reducing the cost of deploying a DAO from $500+ to a few cents.**

## Getting Started with the Polygon Testnet

* Connect your Web3 wallet to the Polygon Testnet and deposit "test-MATIC".

## Getting Started with Polygon

### **Connect your Web3 wallet to the Polygon network**

Connect your Web3 wallet to the Polygon network and deposit at least 0.2 MATIC.

### Deploying a DAO

1. Go to the [Aragon Client](https://client.aragon.org/#/) page.

1. Click _**Connect account**_ and select your wallet provider. In the example below, we have connected our Metamask account to the Polygon network. If the dialogue box says that it is connected to another network, switch your wallet to the Polygon network. The connected network is automatically derived from the network selected on the wallet.
2. Click _**Create an Organization**_ and follow [this tutorial](how-to-create-a-dao-using-aragon-client/) that will run you through the creation process
