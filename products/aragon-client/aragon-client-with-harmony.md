## What is Harmony?

[Harmony.one](https://www.harmony.one) is an L2 Ethereum compatible blockchain network with broad compatibility, low costs, and [high transaction rates (allegedly up to 10M/ sec)](https://medium.com/@aervinaervin/harmony-10million-transactions-per-second-e8161b7b7f61). It is an 'Effective Proof of Stake' network, where users can transact with each other for fraction of the Mainnet transaction costs.

Assets on Ethereum can be moved to Harmony and back again using [bridges](https://docs.harmony.one/home/general/horizon-bridge/bridging-eth-one). By reducing the cost of deploying a DAO from $500+ to a few cents Aragon hopes to inspire hundreds of businesses and non-profits to enter into the Web3 economy.

## Getting Started with Harmony Testnet

Connect your Web3 wallet to the Harmony Testnet and deposit "test-ONE".

## Deploying a DAO

1. Go to the [Aragon Client](https://client.aragon.org/#/) page.

1. Click _**Connect account**_ and select your wallet provider. In the example below, we have connected our Metamask account to the Harmony network. If the dialogue box says that it is connected to another network, switch your wallet to the Harmony network. The connected network is automatically derived from the network selected on the wallet
2. Click _**Create an Organization**_ and follow [this tutorial](how-to-create-a-dao-using-aragon-client/) that will run you through the creation process.
