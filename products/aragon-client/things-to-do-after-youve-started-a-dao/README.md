# After you've started a DAO

Once you have started a DAO there are some additional tools you may want to consider using to help monitor and promote the work you're doing.

* Head over to [DeepDao.io](https://deepdao.io) and make sure you've been listed for their analytics.
* Go to [Dune.xyz](https://dune.xyz) and build your own dashboard [https://dune.xyz/browse/dashboards?q=aragon](https://dune.xyz/browse/dashboards?q=aragon) there have been many built already, and you can customize these to get a better understanding of how your DAO works in practice.
* If you're planning on fundraising you may want to list your new token on Uniswap [https://www.leewayhertz.com/tokens-on-uniswap-exchange/](https://www.leewayhertz.com/tokens-on-uniswap-exchange/) is a tutorial for that.
* Form a[ legal wrapper](https://a16z.com/2022/05/23/dao-legal-frameworks-entity-features-selection/) for your DAO! Working with Otoco.io and Gnosis-safe.io you can now build a DAO and port your governance tokens in to [Otoco.io ](https://otoco.io)to begin developing legal compliance in your work.  [More info here](https://documentation.aragon.org/products/aragon-client/legal-wrappers)
* If you are opening up your DAO to the public and have made significant changes to the default template settings you may consider having an audit done - reach out to the Tech Support Guild for additional resources.
* Communicate with the community - join us on Discord to have your work showcased.
