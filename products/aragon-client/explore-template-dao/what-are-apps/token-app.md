# Tokens App

The Tokens app is used to **mint new tokens** and **assign** them to yourself or other entities. Tokens minted by the Tokens app **confer voting abilities** to holders of the tokens.

For instructions on minting new tokens with EVM Crispr go here [https://docs.evmcrispr.blossom.software/aragonOS/token-manager/](https://docs.evmcrispr.blossom.software/aragonOS/token-manager/)&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
#### What is minting?

Minting is the process of creating new tokens. You can create as many tokens as you'd like (as long as members of the organization are agree). This means you can add as many new users to your organization as you wish, you just need to mint new tokens for them. Below we will show "How to Add new tokens" into your Organization.
{% endhint %}

## Reasons to mint tokens for entities

* The organization commits to giving its workers a stake in the company e.g. half of the company tokens are held by workers and the other half by investors .
* The organization mints tokens to entities proportional to the amount of funds they have invested in the company.
* The organization mints a specific amount of tokens for an entity in exchange for a specific good or service .
* The organization mints a fixed amount of tokens per month and distributes them proportionally to everyone who has contributed value to the organization that month.

## Using Tokens app with different templates

The Tokens app is used to **manage membership** and **voting power** in an organization. To add members to an organization, itâ€™s as easy as minting and assigning a token to them.

This simple process for managing membership and voting power provides the foundation for governing the resources of an organization using Aragon.

### Company template

On the Company template, one token equals one vote, members can hold as many tokens as are assigned to them, and tokens are transferable.

### Membership template

With the Membership template, one token also equals one vote, but members cannot hold more than one token each and tokens are non-transferable.

### Reputation template

Regarding the Reputation template, one token equals one vote, and members can hold as many tokens as are assigned to them, but the tokens are non-transferable.

## **Holder**

In the _Holder_ section of the _Tokens_ app, you can see the current list of token holders and the balance of organization tokens they each hold.

### Clicking on the dropdown menu on one of the rows in the list will provide you options for:

* Assigning more tokens to that token holder (_Add tokens_ option).
* Removing tokens from the token holder (_Remove tokens_ option).
* Editing a custom label (for more about this go [here](../home.md)).

## **Token Info**

In the _**Token Info**_ section you can see information about the token that is used for governance in your organization.

### **Token supply**

How many tokens have been minted in total?

### **Transferable**

Whether or not the token can be transferred to another entity after it has been assigned.

### Token

The token name and token symbol.

## **Ownership Distribution**

In the _**Ownership Distribution**_ section, you can see which entities own what percent of the organizationâ€™s token supply. This can be helpful as a spot check to see how token ownership is concentrated in the organization.

## **Add Tokens**

If you need to add members to your organization and assign them DAO tokens, you need to use the _**Add Token**_ option.

If you click the \*\* **\_**Add Tokens**\_** \*\* button, a panel will open up with text fields for entering:

* _**The recipient**_: the address of the entity you want to assign tokens to.
* _**Number of tokens**_: how many tokens you want to assign.

After you enter this information, you can click the button in the panel to finish completing the action.

![Add token](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c98a4fe0428633d2cf3fcf7/images/5d867e382c7d3a7e9ae174c0/file-gQIE902ZlX.png)

### At this point, the organization still requires a token holder vote for every action.

Click _**Create transaction**_\*\* \*\* to create the transaction that creates a **new vote** to assign the new token you want to mint. Sign the transaction in your Ethereum provider, wait for a confirmation, then move on to the next step.

### \*\*Vote "Yes" to approve the "Assign Tokens" vote \*\*

Go to the Voting app, click on the _**Mint tokens**_ proposal you just created, and vote "Yes" to approve minting and assigning the token.

### **Check out the newest member of your organization**

{% hint style="success" %}
Your organization just went from one to two members. A good start to a new Company organization!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
* If a vote is cast that causes the Approval % to be equal to or greater than the Support required (e.g. 60% required Support with current 65% Approval), then the proposition will be completed automatically.
* If the Approval % is less than the Support required (e.g. 60% required Support with current 40% Approval) then additional "no" votes could still stop the proposition from being passed.

**Thus the proposition will remain open until either the duration is reached or the Approval % is equal to or greater than the Support requirement.**

If you are using [https://evm-crispr.blossom.software/](https://evm-crispr.blossom.software/) you can do things like assign vested tokens to accounts using code such as the following

```
connect <DAO> token-manager
exec token-manager assignVested <ACCOUNT> <AMOUNT>e18 <START-DATE> <CLIFF-DATE> <END-DATE> true
```
