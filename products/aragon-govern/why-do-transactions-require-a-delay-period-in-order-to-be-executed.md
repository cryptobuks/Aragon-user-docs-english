# Reasons for the delay period in the transaction

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn about delay periods and why they are necessary to execute a transaction.

An Aragon Govern DAO works with the principle that participants interacting with it are acting in the best interest of the respective community. It assumes that any scheduled transactions respect the DAO agreement.

To counter and prevent bad actors from executing non-conforming actions, **all transactions** come with a **cool-off period**, allowing community members time to review before execution. This is what is called the "delay period" on Aragon Govern DAOs.

Thanks to the delay period the community has the opportunity to challenge any to-be-executed transaction, ensuring an extra layer of security.
