# What is Aragon Govern?

Aragon Govern is a **DAO framework** that relies on **optimistic governance**, empowering digital groups to operate in a low-friction governance model with on-chain execution and dispute resolution. Aragon Govern ties in with Aragon Voice and thus has low gas fees.

Instead of requiring your community to vote on every single proposal, with Aragon Govern your DAO operates by **continuously executing actions unless these are challenged**. Challenged actions are all safeguarded by [Aragon Court](../aragon-court/), a subjective dispute resolution system. It requires some technical background, yet has considerable potential.
