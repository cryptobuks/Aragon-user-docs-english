{% hint style="success" %}
The Ethereum Network is already set up on your Metamask wallet.

Log in to your wallet and select the Rinkeby Test Network on the dropdown Networks menu.

## **Deposit TEST-ETH to your Rinkeby wallet**

Now you need to load your wallet with enough test-Ether (abbreviated as ETH) to pay for gas. Each transaction on the network requires a gas fee for e.g.:

* transactions for the transfer of funds from your wallet
* the deployment of your organization
* the interactions within your organization

> Important info: Please note that the symbol of the test-ether is "ETH", the same as for mainnet-ether.

#### You can claim TEST-ETH on the Rinkeby Faucet:

* [https://faucet.rinkeby.io/](https://faucet.rinkeby.io)
* [https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby)
