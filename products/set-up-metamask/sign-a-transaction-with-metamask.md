# How to sign a transaction?

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn about how to sign a transaction in your DAO using Metamask.
{% endhint %}

## The process of signing transaction explained

### Open up the Metamask browser extension and log in.

If you are using Chrome you should be able to do this by clicking on the fox icon located to the right of your address bar.

If you can't see it, [click here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/metamask). This will open up an interface to your Ethereum wallet. Set up your wallet as described [here](./).

### Select the network and the account you want to use.

In the Metamask wallet, select the network and the account you want to use. Access your DAO, connect your Metamask wallet, and interact with the DAO (for example by adding a new member in the Token App).

### Add a token.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the following example, we will add a new token and we will show how to sign the transaction to finalize this. If you need help on "How to add tokens to your Dao" please go [here](../aragon-client/explore-template-dao/what-are-apps/token-app.md).
