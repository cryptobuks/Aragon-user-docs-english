## **Deposit test-METIS token to your Stardust wallet**

### **What is** $METIS TEST?

$METIS TEST token is the test-METIS used on Stardust to pay for transaction fees (abbreviated as "METIS") and, consequently, to deploy a DAO, in the same way, that test-ETH is used on Rinkeby.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that the symbol of the test-METIS is "METIS", the same as for the mainnet-METIS.
{% endhint %}

### How to get TEST-METIS tokens?

* Switch to the Rinkeby test network on your Metamask
* Import Token

You will need to import the Metis token. Click on the _**Import Token**_ option on Metamask and copy-paste the Metis token address `0xe552fb52a4f19e44ef5a967632dbc320b0820639`. You will then see your Metis token balance.

* Get Rinkeby Ether

{% hint style="warning" %}
This step is applicable if you do not have any tokens at all or if you have a fresh account with 0 Metis balance. If you need some Rinkeby test "ETH" go [here](getting-started-with-rinkeby-testnet.md).
{% endhint %}

* Get Metis on Rinkeby

Head over to [https://rinkeby-faucet.metis.io/](https://rinkeby-faucet.metis.io) and make sure your account is connected.

Confirm the transaction and wait until it is completed. Once all instructions are followed, you will receive a message informing you that the transaction was successful and that your wallet was updated.

* Transfer tokens from L1 (layer 1) to L2 (layer 2)

Go to the [bridge](https://bridge.metis.io) to transfer tokens from L1 to L2. Select the _**Rinkeby Testnet Network**_ in your Metamask wallet.

Select _**deposit**_ => _**Metis**_ and insert the amount as shown in the image below. Confirm the transactions and wait.

Select the _**Metis Stardust Network**_ in your Metamask wallet for seeing your test-METIS ($METIS) ready for use.
