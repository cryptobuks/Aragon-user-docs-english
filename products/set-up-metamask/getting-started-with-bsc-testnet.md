## **Deposit test-BNB token to your BSC Testnet wallet**

You will then need to load your wallet with enough test-BNB (abbreviated as "BNB") to pay for gas fees when you deploy your organization and make transactions within the organization.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the symbol of the test-BNB is _**BNB**_ - _\*\*\*\*_ the same as for mainnet-BNB.
{% endhint %}
