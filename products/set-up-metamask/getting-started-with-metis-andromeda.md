## **Deposit at least 0.2 METIS to your Andromeda wallet**

### **What is** $METIS?

$METIS is the currency used on Andromeda to pay for transaction fees and, consequently, to deploy a DAO, in the same way that $ETH is used on Ethereum.

### How to get $METIS?

$METIS needs to be transferred onto the Andromeda Network using a 'bridge' such as this bridge [here.](https://bridge.metis.io/home) It allows you to bring the $METIS from the Ethereum Network to $METIS on the Metis Andromeda Mainnet.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**How much $METIS is necessary to deploy a DAO?**

At least 0.2 $METIS is required to deploy an Aragon DAO, though the actual cost might be much less.
