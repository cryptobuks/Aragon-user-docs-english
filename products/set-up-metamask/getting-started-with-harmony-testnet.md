## **Deposit TEST ONE to your Harmony test wallet**

### What is TEST ONE?

TEST ONE token is used on the Harmony Testnet. It is used to:

* pay for transaction fees (abbreviated as ONE)
* to deploy a DAO in the same way that test-ETH is used on Rinkeby

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the symbol of the test-ONE is "ONE", the same as for mainnet-ONE.
{% endhint %}

### How to get your Harmony One address for the faucet?

* Go to [https://explorer.harmony.one/](https://explorer.harmony.one).
* Copy the account address from your Metamask wallet and paste it into the search bar.
* It should output an address that begins with _**one1**._
* You will need to copy that address and then insert it at [https://faucet.pops.one/](https://faucet.pops.one).
* In a couple of seconds you should receive 1000 TEST ONE to deploy your DAO.
