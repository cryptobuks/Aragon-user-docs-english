# Gas Tracker

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your Ethereum provider - Metamask, should pre-fill the correct gas limit and the gas price, but sometimes the amount will be too low which causes transactions to last longer or not take place at all.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can assert an optimal gas cost and adjust it in the transaction settings of your wallet during the transaction approval process.
{% endhint %}
