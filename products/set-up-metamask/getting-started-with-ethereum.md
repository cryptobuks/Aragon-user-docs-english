# Getting started with Ethereum

{% hint style="info" %}
In this section, you will learn how to connect and use your Web3 wallet on the Ethereum Network (also called Ethereum Mainnet).
{% endhint %}

## **Connect your Web3 wallet to the Ethereum Network**

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend using [Metamask wallet](./) as your Web3 wallet.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
The Ethereum Network is already set up on your Metamask wallet.
{% endhint %}

Log in to your wallet and select the Ethereum Mainnet on the dropdown Networks menu.

## **Deposit at least 0.2 ETH to your Ethereum wallet.**

Now you need to load your wallet with enough Ether (abbreviated as ETH) to pay for gas. Each transaction on the network requires a gas fee for e.g.:

* transactions for the transfer of funds from your wallet
* the deployment of your organization
* the interactions within your organization

{% hint style="info" %}
$ETH is a cryptocurrency native to the Ethereum network and can be acquired from any [cryptocurrency exchange that lists ETH](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/how-to-buy-ether/).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**How much $ETH is necessary to deploy a DAO?**

As a rough estimate of how much ETH you will need: multiply the [current “standard” gas price in gwei](https://ethgasstation.info) by 0.02.

**For example:** at a standard gas price of 10 gwei, you should have 0.2 ETH in your wallet. You can estimate the necessary gas price [here](gas-tracker.md).
