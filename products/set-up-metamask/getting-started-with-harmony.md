## **Deposit at least 0.2 ONE to your Harmony wallet**

### What is ONE?

ONE is the currency used on Harmony to pay for transaction fees and, consequently, to deploy a DAO, in the same way that ETH is used on Ethereum.

### How to get ONE?

$ONE needs to be transferred onto the Polygon network using a 'bridge' such as [https://bridge.harmony.one/busd](https://bridge.harmony.one/busd). An alternative bridge can be found [here](https://synapseprotocol.com/?inputCurrency=USDT\&outputCurrency=USDC\&outputChain=1666600000).

{% hint style="danger" %}
**How much $ONE is necessary to deploy a DAO?**

At least 0.2 $ONE is required to deploy an Aragon DAO, though the actual cost might be much less.
