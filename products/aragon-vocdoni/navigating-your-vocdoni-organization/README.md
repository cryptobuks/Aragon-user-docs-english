All these sections will be described below.

If you haven't made a backup of your account you will see an alert message shown in an orange box (see the example above).

**=> In this case, please, proceed with the backup of your account as described in the** **dedicated paragraph** **below.**
{% endhint %}

### Voting box

The list of the votes is in the dedicated box.

The Votes are grouped by:

* **Active votes:** open vote proposals
* **Ended Votes:** closed vote proposals
* **Upcoming Votes:** vote proposals that aren't already opened

### Create account backup <a href="#createaccountbackup" id="createaccountbackup"></a>

On the _**Download credentials**_ page you can protect your entity's account by exporting it and storing it in a safe place.

* Select in the drop-down menu your favorite 3 Recovery questions and fill in your replies.
* Confirm your password.
* Check the box with the acknowledgment of losing the password.
