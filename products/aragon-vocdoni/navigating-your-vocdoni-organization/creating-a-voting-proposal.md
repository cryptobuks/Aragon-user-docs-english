### Who can Vote Page

On the _**Who can Vote**_ page you can:

* _**Select the voting options**_**:** _normal voting_ (where all the voters have the same voting power) and _weighted voting_ (where voters may have different voting power)
* _**Import the list of voters**_**:** only the voters on the list can vote on the voting process. To create the list of voters you can download the available template (\*\* _**Download template**_ \*\* button), adjust the fields (you can add for example the National Id) and then drag and drop the file (.csv, .xlsx, .ods formats are supported).
