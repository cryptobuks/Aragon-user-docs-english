# General troubleshooting tips

If you are having trouble performing an action that you expect you should be able to perform

* Make sure Aragon has permission to access your Ethereum provider. If you see a button that says "Connect account" in the top-right corner of the Aragon client, then click that button and allow Aragon to access your Ethereum account. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...
* Make sure your Ethereum provider is unlocked, on the correct network, and open to the correct account. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...
* Make sure you are setting the proper [gas limit](https://ethgasstation.info/blog/gas-limit/) and paying a reasonable [gas price](https://ethgasstation.info). Your Ethereum provider _should_ pre-fill the correct gas limit and gas price, but sometimes it will pre-fill the amounts too low. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...
* If you are using a hardware wallet such as Ledger, make sure you have "Contract data" and "Blind signing" enabled. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work..
* Reload the page in your browser. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...
* Disable the ad-blocker in your browser (if enabled). Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...
* Go to the Settings page and click the "Clear application cache" button. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...
* Check the connection status in the top-right of the Aragon client. It should say "Connected to the network". Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...
* Make sure your computer is properly connected to the internet. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...
* Make sure all of the software in your toolchain is up-to-date: your browser, your Ethereum provider, your hardware wallet firmware, etc. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...
* Try disabling and re-enabling or un-installing and re-installing any browser extensions that may be faulty, including your Ethereum provider/ wallet browser extension. Try the action again, and if it still doesn’t work...
* Search the [issues](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/issues) in the Aragon GitHub repository to see if your issue has already been reported. If you do not find an issue that matches your issue, [create a new issue](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/issues/new) or leave a message in the [Aragon Chat #questions channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/672466989217873929/694844628586856469) describing the issue.
