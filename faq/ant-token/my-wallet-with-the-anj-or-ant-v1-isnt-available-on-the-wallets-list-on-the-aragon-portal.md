# My wallet (with the ANJ or ANT v1) isn't available on the wallets list on the Aragon Portal

If your wallet isn't available in the list of wallets on the Aragon Portal, you can choose an available wallet on the list proposed on the Aragon Portal. There you can create a new account and move the tokens from your wallet to the new wallet. Then proceed with the swap on the portal. Alternatively you can import your seed phrase into the new wallet, connect the new wallet to the portal and proceed with the swap.
