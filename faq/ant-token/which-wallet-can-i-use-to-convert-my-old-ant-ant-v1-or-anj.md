# Which wallet can I use to convert my old ANT (ANT v1 or ANJ)?

Go to the conversion portal [here](https://upgrade.aragon.org/#/):

* Choose a wallet available on the list (click the “connect wallet” button)
* Create a new account
* Move the tokens from your wallet to the new wallet
* Proceed with the swap on the portal

Alternatively you can import your seed phrase into the new wallet, connect the new wallet to the portal and proceed with the swap.
