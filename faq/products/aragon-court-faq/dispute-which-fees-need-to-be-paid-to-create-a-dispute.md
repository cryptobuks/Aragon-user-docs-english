# Dispute - Which fees need to be paid to create a dispute?

The fees required to create a dispute are:

* Juror fees: `(Juror_Fee) x 3`
  * It is multiplied by three because three guardians are drafted in the first dispute round.
* Draft fees: `(Draft_Fee) x 3`
  * These are intended to cover transaction fees for drafting.
* Settlement fees: `(Settle_Fee) x 3`
  * These are intended to cover transaction fees for settling penalties.
