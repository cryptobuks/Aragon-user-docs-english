# Voting - What happens if there is a tie?

In case of a tie, the highest priority option will be chosen. Refuse to vote will always be the highest priority. On top of that, organizations subscribed to the Court can set up their own priority. Everything else works the same. So, for instance, given a priority of Block > Allow, if in the second round 1 guardians refuses to vote, 4 vote Block and 4 vote Allow, the final outcome (for that round) will be Block. If there are no appeals in that round, then Block is the final ruling and the 4 guardians that voted Block will be rewarded and the rest will be slashed.
