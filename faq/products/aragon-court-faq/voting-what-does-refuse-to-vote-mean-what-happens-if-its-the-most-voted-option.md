# Voting - What does "Refuse to vote" mean? What happens if it's the most voted option?

This is an option guardians can choose if they think that the arguments are not complete or coherent enough to make a decision or they think that the dispute doesn't belong in the Court (in the future there may be different specialized Courts). "Refuse to vote" works like any other option: if it's the most voted option, guardians who voted for it get rewards, all the rest get slashed.
