# What is the current duration of the different stages of a dispute?

Currently, the different stage lengths are:

* Argument submission: 7 days. It can be cut short if the Aragon Court subscriber decides to cut it short (commonly if both parties signal that they are done with argument submission).
* Vote commitment: 2 days
* Vote reveal: 2 days
* Appeal: 2 days
* Appeal confirmation: 2 days
* What is the current configuration of Aragon Court's parameters?

You can find Aragon Court's current parameters, including the values for modifiable parameters such as `Juror_Fee`, `Draft_Fee`, and `Settle_Fee`, on the backend monitoring dashboard.
