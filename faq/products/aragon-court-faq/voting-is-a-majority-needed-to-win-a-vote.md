# Voting - Is a majority needed to win a vote?

No, it's not a majority winner but rather the [plurality](https://help.aragon.org/article/41-aragon-court#plurality) winner. The most voted ruling outcome wins. For example, if there are 9 guardians (round 2) and 4 votes "Allow", 2 votes "Block" and 3 votes "Refuse to vote", the winning outcome of that round would be "Allow", because that outcome received the most votes out of the available options.
