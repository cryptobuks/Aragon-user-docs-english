# Dispute - Do I need to put collateral to create a dispute?

Aragon Court doesn't require a collateral deposit in order to create a dispute.

The Aragon Court subscriber can require a collateral deposit, and has absolute control over this setting: the amount, who pays for it, how it is redistributed when a verdict is ruled, etc.

Aragon Court does require collateral to appeal disputes and confirm appeals (see next section).
