# Voting - What's the penalty for leaked votes?

It's the same as for guardians on the losing side of a final ruling. When a cast vote is leaked it's overwritten to "leaked" instead of the original outcome chosen by the guardians, so it can never be on the winning side, even if their original cast vote would have been on the winning side.
