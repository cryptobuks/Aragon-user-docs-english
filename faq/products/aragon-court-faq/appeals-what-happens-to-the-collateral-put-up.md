# Appeals - What happens to the collateral put up

If the final ruling is neither the ruling proposed by the appealing party nor the confirming party a portion of the collateral is used to pay fees, and the rest is returned to the collateral's previous owner. The fees are used to pay the winning guardians and pay for the incentivized operations of drafting and settling penalties. The fees paid are, per guardian:

* `Juror_Fee`
* `Draft_Fee`
* `Settle_Fee`
