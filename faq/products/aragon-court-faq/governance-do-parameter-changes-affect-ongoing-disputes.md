# Governance - Do parameter changes affect ongoing disputes?

No, a dispute gets its parameters when it's created and keeps them during the whole life-cycle. So if for instance while a dispute is being adjudicated in the first round the voting period is reduced from 2 days to 1, the dispute will still have a voting period of 2 days all the way through to the final ruling.
