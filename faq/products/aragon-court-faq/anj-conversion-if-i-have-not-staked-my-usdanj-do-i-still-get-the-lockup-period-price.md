# ANJ conversion - If I have not staked my $ANJ, do I still get the lockup period price?

If you have converted your $ANJ, the resulting $ANT is automatically staked into Aragon Court v2 and locked until the 5th of October 2021.

If you have $ANJ staked in the Aragon Court v1, you will first need to [unstake it](https://v1.court.aragon.org) and send it to your wallet before you can do the conversion.
