# Is Vocdoni anonymous?

Right now Vocdoni is anonymous to anyone auditing the process, even though the entity's administrator may be able to identify voters.

In Q2 2021, a new version of the voting protocol has been released which makes use of advanced cryptographic mechanisms called zk-SNARKs to achieve full anonymity.

If you want to know more about these cryptographic mechanisms you can check out our technical documentation [here](https://docs.vocdoni.io).
