# Is my data safe with Vocdoni?

Yes, it is. In the current version of Vocdoni, no personal data is stored to create the voting censuses. Basically, private keys are generated on the entity manager's device based on specific information of the voting participants.

The coming versions of Vocdoni will incorporate a sovereign digital identity system and consent mechanisms which guarantee the users' complete control over their data.

In the actual system, the keys that identify each user, are created and stored locally in each user's terminal, along with the rest of their details. An exchange protocol allows you to share the indispensable credentials with the organization's servers in order to verify your identity.

A built-in consent mechanism generates a signature to indicate how the data should be used. This allows complete control of the current and historical use of the data by the user while allowing organizations to manage their data with full GDPR compliance.
