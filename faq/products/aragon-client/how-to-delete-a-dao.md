# How to delete a DAO

The DAOs are deployed on the blockchain so they can't be deleted.

The token of the DAO can be 'burned' however:

* If your DAO is on the **Ethereum** network you can send your tokens to this address: _**0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD**_ to 'burn' them.
* If your DAO is on the **Polygon** network you can send your tokens to this address: **0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD** to 'burn' them.
* If your DAO is on the **Harmony** network you can send your tokens to this address: **one10000000000000000000000000000dead5shlag** to burn them.
