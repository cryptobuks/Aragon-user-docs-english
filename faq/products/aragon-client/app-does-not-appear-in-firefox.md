# App does not appear in Firefox

Some pre-Aragon 0.6 apps do not load in newer versions of the Firefox browser. When the user visits these apps, they show up as blank pages like this:

To fix this error in your organization, you have to update the app version of the app that is showing up blank to a newer version of the app using the [App Center.](../../../products/aragon-client/explore-template-dao/system-setting/app-center.md)

If the Voting app is one of the apps affected by this problem, and you need to approve a vote to complete the app update, then you have to use either the in-client [Console](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/blob/master/docs/CONSOLE.md#power-user-console) or [aragonCLI](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli) to vote on the App Upgrade proposal.

If you need any help casting your vote using the Console or aragonCLI you can ask for help in [Aragon Chat](https://aragon.chat) or send an email to [support@aragon.org](https://secure.helpscout.net/mailbox/b3f2f8de3c191a09/2804751/).
