# DAO creation taking a long time to confirm

If your organization is taking too long to launch, it may be due to an insufficient gas price. Your Ethereum provider (e.g. Metamask) _should_ pre-fill the correct gas limit and gas price, but sometimes it will pre-fill the amounts too low. Below are the recommended actions you can take to evaluate whether this is the case:

* Make sure you're paying a reasonable gas price. Check the value on the blockchain scan [here](../../../products/set-up-metamask/gas-tracker.md). Think of gas as a budget for the miner to process your transaction.
* You may want to increase the gas limit, which will allow more transactions per second to be processed by the blockchain. Learn more about Ethereum gas limits [here](https://legacy.ethgasstation.info/blog/gas-limit).
* If you are using Metamask as your Ethereum provider, read [here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022895972) on how you can adjust the gas price and gas limits for your transactions.
