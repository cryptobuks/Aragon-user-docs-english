# Why do I see a Blue Screen?

Some users reported that when setting up an organization the browser is stuck on a blue screen with the Aragon logo.

Essentially, your web browser can not access the URL where the web app is actually hosted (decentralized file storage called IPFS).

In order to solve the problem please do the following:

* If you are using a VPN, please try to set it to a different server location or turn it off.
* Delete all cached data for the website.
* Refresh the page.
