# About ANT

A high-level overview of the Aragon Network Token can be found on its [token page](https://aragon.org/token/ant).

## ANT uses

### Governance

The first use of ANT is as a Sybil-resistant mechanism for governance.

Current community polls backed by ANT can be found on the Aragon Project's Snapshot Space. Further uses of ANT are being researched and will be proposed following the launch of the Aragon Network, with ANT embedded as its governance token.

In the past, ANT was used in the [Aragon Governance Proposal (AGP) process](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-1.md#aragon-network-votes), [first approved by ANT holders](https://aragon.org/blog/final-results-from-the-agp-1-vote) on November 17, 2018. In this construction, one ANT was equal to one vote, allowing anyone to vote on AGPs--even while remaining pseudonymous, by acquiring and holding ANT at the time of a vote. In preparation for the Aragon Network's launch, ANT holders voted to [sunset the AGP process](https://aragon.org/blog/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-6) on March 13, 2020.

### Further issuance

ANT's total supply is currently fixed at 39,609,523 ANT. This total supply will be constant only until the Aragon Network is deployed. From then on, ANT holders will participate in Aragon Network governance to decide ANT's issuance policy and inflation rate going forward.

## ANT asset analysis

On October 22, 2019, Aragon One Researcher Luke Duncan published an analysis of ANT entitled "[ANT Demand Modeling Framework](https://forum.aragon.org/t/ant-demand-modeling-framework/1389)". Duncan described the document as "a basic framework for thinking about the demand for the Aragon Network Token (ANT) based on its current and potential future utility value".

On March 6, 2020, the venture capital firm Placeholder published an analysis of ANT entitled "[Aragon (ANT) Economics](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/3/6/aragon-ant-economics)". Placeholder refers to ANT in their analysis as "a governance asset, with planned future economics to reinforce its store-of-value status".
