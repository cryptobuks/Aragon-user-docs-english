How Aragon and the AN DAO are structured
{% endhint %}

## The Aragon Association

The Aragon project is stewarded by the **Aragon Association**, a non-profit entity based in Zug, Switzerland, and governed by **Aragon Network Token (ANT)** **holders**.

**Within this legal infrastructure, the DAO is subdivided to streamline governance and execution:**

### **Main DAO**

The Main DAO is an Aragon Govern DAO that acts as the executor for community votes on Aragon Voice, enabling $ANT holders to exercise a direct token-weighted democracy over the network.

### **Executive Sub-DAO**

The Executive Sub-DAO (ESD) acts as strategy facilitator and finance director for the AN DAO. The ESD is responsible for scheduling payments and deciding on which initiatives to fund.

### **Compliance Sub-DAO**

Committee members of the Compliance Sub-DAO review all proposals to the AN DAO and any sub-DAO for compliance within the Charter and overall legal compliance, providing feedback to proposal creators where appropriate. They are charged with removing any proposals they deem to be non-compliant with any part of this Charter or illegal and assume full legal responsibility for the approval of any illegal, unlawful, criminal or fraudulent proposals.

### **Tech Committee**

The Tech Committee is responsible for overseeing the quality of the Aragon Network's code and [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart\_contract). Members of the Committee are required to review technical proposals in the Main DAO and sub-DAOs and either remove any offending proposals, suspend proposals pending a 3rd party audit or approve beneficial proposals that do not require an audit. The Committee will merge any approved repositories.
