# Why use Aragon to build a DAO?

### Aragon is the major player in building DAOs

With Aragon you can have your DAO on **Ethereum or other blockchains**. Most of the DAOs currently operational are either built directly on Aragon or have forked Aragon's open source code.

### **Aragon is community-driven wi**th a full-time development team

Our users always have a say on how the platform evolves. Aragon is transparent. You can talk to developers in Discord or on our forum and ask any question. Beyond that we have our in-house team that works exclusively on upgrading the Aragon ecosystem.

### **Aragon offers user-friendly guides**

We provide information about how to build DAOs and a welcoming community that will help you out with advice. And if you are not confident, you may work with our emerging 3rd party developer network.
